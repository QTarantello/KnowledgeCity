# KnowledgeCity (test task)

The project is a test task at the KnowledgeCity company for a Frontend Developer position. I had a following requirements: to create a simple login system and a page with users table without using any frameworks or bundlers. I created my own fetch function for server emulation and its results depend on url and entered params. Authorization data is stored in LocalStorage. Because of I didn't use bundler and JS-modules, I divided the project into separate files. Actually It's not good practice, but for this project, it was enough.  

## Project launch
